__VR Bird's Eye View__

1-Pick a sensor on your body - a transducer - converts physical energy to digital signals.
2-Each sensor moves through space (or changes in some way) 
  - controled by the brain & CNC
  - degrees of freedom - DOF > EAR has 6 DOF's - translation and rotation
  - configuration of space
  
EAR> 3 DOF translation + 3 DOF rotation
EYE> 6 DOF of the head + 2 DOF rotation (...)

*** We create an 'alternate generated world' ans input to a sense to fool the brain ***
