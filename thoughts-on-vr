// thoughts on Virtual Reality - philosophical visions of the medium
My thoughts on VR

1-  VR is a new medium as storytelling concerns
2 - Is not Gaming neither traditional Cinema storytelling
3 - Is different and the approach has to be different

* When you are left alone in VR you can have Fun doing random things like a baby would do or...
...you need a Mission like in real life to feel fulfilled ?

4 - PRESENCE - is the Key Factor on having a proper experience of VR 
  - The ART of being fully in the present is very much related with >

4a -  MEDITATION - Being in the NOW - Same space - Slower time
4b -  OUT OF THE BODY EXPERIENCE - OBE > Being in the NOW - other space - other time
4c -  VR - Other space - Same time

Through the study of the factors on how one feels deeply in the now in these 3 different PRESENCE experiences
we can help to evolve the VR into the future.
